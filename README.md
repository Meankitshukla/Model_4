PCA and Cluster Method on Mushroom Classification.

We will be using the Mushroom Dataset from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository to perform our demonstration.

Stated concisely our problem is the binary classification of a mushroom as edible or poisonous.
We are given a dataset with 23 features including the class (edible or poisonous) of the mushroom.
